# Recipe-Roulette
**Introduction**
Recipe Roulette is a smart web application designed to provide personalized recipe suggestions based on users' dietary restrictions, food preferences, and cooking skill levels. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrated with the Spoonacular API, the app simplifies meal planning by offering curated recipes with nutritional information and step-by-step instructions. It aims to make cooking more accessible, reduce time spent on decision-making, and encourage users to explore healthier and more diverse meals suited to their needs.

**Problem Statement**
>Users with dietary restrictions struggle to find suitable recipes:	People with allergies, medical conditions, or specific diets (like vegan or gluten-free) 	often face difficulty finding meals that meet their 
 needs without extensive searching.

>Meal planning is time-consuming and often lacks variety:	Many users spend too much time looking for what to cook and end up repeating t	he 	same recipes due to a lack of personalized suggestions.

>Existing apps lack personalized filtering based on cooking skills and preferences:	Most platforms suggest recipes without considering the user's skill level or 	preferred ingredients, which can make cooking 
 frustrating or too challenging.

>Nutritional transparency is not always clearly provided:	Users trying to manage their health or track calories often donâ€™t get detailed 	nutritional breakdowns in recipe apps, limiting informed food choices.
